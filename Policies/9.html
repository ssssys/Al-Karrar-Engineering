              <h2 class="title">BUSINESS TRAVEL & EXPENSE POLICY</h2>
              <div class="content">
                <p>This policy covers both Business Travel and Entertainment Expenditures. It is every employee's
                  responsibility to remain vigilant about expenses by controlling spending and scrutinizing the
                  costeffectiveness of business decisions.<br><br>
                  <b>Justification for Business Travel</b><br>
                  1. Employees must carefully evaluate the need for business travel. Alternatives such as
                  teleconferencing, video-conferencing or web conferencing should be considered prior to initiate
                  travel reservations. Every effort must be made to take advantage of savings through proper trip
                  planning.<br><br>
                  <b>Authorization of Business Travel</b><br>
                  2. All overseas business trips must be approved by Chairman, CEO or COO prior to departure. If
                  employees fail to obtain prior approval for business travel, they are liable to disciplinary action
                  for such unauthorized trips even though subsequent approval might be obtained.<br><br>
                  <b>Travel Agency</b><br>
                  3. All domestic and overseas business travel arrangements must be made through the appointed
                  travel agencies authorized by the Chairman in order to maximize discount levels and every effort
                  must be made to take advantage of savings through proper trip planning.<br><br>
                  <b>Overseas Traveling</b><br>
                  4. Airfare entitlement is as stipulated in accordance with the Travelling Policy as amended from time
                  to time.<br>
                  a. In general, Economy Class is our standard for all cadres for domestic & international travelling.<br>
                  b. For travelers who are on extended business trips for several weeks or more, it is acceptable to
                  remain in the country or location with hotel and meal reimbursed, if the cost is cheaper than the
                  airfare for a return to the home location.<br><br>
                  5. Flight changes should be explained on the Travel Claim Form and unused air tickets must be
                  returned to the HR or Accounts departments against receipt to arrange for a refund and will be
                  subject to audit. They should not be retained for future use.<br><br>
                  6. Any deviations from the above policy must have the prior approval of the Chairman, CEO or COO.
                  Employees will be held personally responsible for the difference in the cost of airfare for any
                  unapproved upgrades.<br><br>
                  7. For ground transportation, employees are responsible for selecting the most reasonable and
                  economical means of transportation (i.e., taxis, shuttles, airport rail or bus services and public
                  transportation).<br><br>
                  <b>Travel Advances</b><br>
                  8. Whenever appropriate employees on travel should settle business expenses by credit card or
                  charge such expenses to company accounts. Employees may, where appropriate for prolonged
                  business trips, apply for cash advance to meet anticipated out-of-pocket business expenses that
                  are not chargeable to credit card or accounts. The requested amount should be indicated in the
                  Travel Authorization Form for approval.<br><br>
                  9. Cash advances must be reconciled against claimed business expenses. Outstanding balance due
                  to a business trip shall be settled by employees as soon as practicable.<br><br>
                  <b>Frequent Travel Programs</b><br>
                  10.Employees who join frequent travel programs do so voluntarily and are responsible for related
                  administration. Fees associated with these memberships are not reimbursable.<br><br>
                  11.Frequent travel programs must not impact travel arrangements. Air ticket and hotel reservations
                  must be cost effective and in compliance with policy without regard to the frequent travel programs.<br><br>
                  <b>Corporate Credit Cards</b><br>
                  12.No employee may be issued with any credit card charged to or guaranteed by company.<br><br>
                  <b>Mobile Phone Expenses and IDD calls</b><br>
                  13.Business usage of personal mobile phones during overseas travel will be reimbursed only if the
                  employee is authorized to use mobile phone services.<br><br>
                  14.IDD calls made from hotel rooms are normally charged at a premium. Whenever practicable,
                  cheaper modes of long-distance calls such as prepaid phone cards or portable phones
                  provided by a Al Karrar should be used.<br><br>
                  <b>Hotel Expenses</b><br>
                  15.Employees are to be accommodated in standard rooms only. Where meeting facility is required,
                  business center should be used. Special circumstances requiring an upgrade must be submitted
                  to the Chairman for prior approval via the Travel Authorization Form.<br><br>
                  16.Employees should use preferred hotels as recommended by management unless the prepaid rates
                  or the agency rates via the appointed travel agents are more competitive. Staff should plan their
                  business travel properly so that appointed travel agents can recommend the hotel option that is the
                  most cost efficient.<br><br>
                  17.Laundry or dry-cleaning expenses will not be reimbursed if the duration of each business trip is
                  less than 04 days.<br><br>
                  18.Expenditure on in-room mini-bar facilities should be avoided or it will be considered as a personal
                  expense, apart from acceptable levels of bottled water. Other hotel expenses such as in-room
                  movies, fitness center costs, any tips other than the local custom and practice are not reimbursable.<br><br>
                  <b>Meal Expenses during Overseas Travel</b><br>
                  19.Good judgment should be exercised when incurring the spending. HR may establish guidelines for
                  their travelling employees for an acceptable spending on meals in line with the prevailing local
                  practice or financial consideration.<br><br>
                  20.During business travel, buying of meals for local employees should be minimized. Where such
                  expenses are deemed required, the name and title/job position of each employee invited should
                  be documented and such information provided in the Expense Report.<br><br>
                  21.Business entertainment meals should follow the guidelines described in section Business Meal
                  Expenditure.<br><br>
                  <b>Communication during Business Travel</b><br>
                  22.To maintain effective communication within the management, employees should notify their seniors
                  about their contact numbers and other means of communication during travel. Contact numbers
                  and addresses during business trips should be submitted.<br><br>
                  <b>Business Meal Expenditure</b><br>
                  23.Where the meal is for business entertainment, the purpose, company name, name and position of
                  guests invited must be stated on the receipt; in general, a meal should be paid for, and claimed by,
                  the most senior person at the meal with the exception for events with more than 10 attendees, then
                  the event organizer could pay and claim for the expenditure.<br><br>
                  24.All meals expenditure should be marked as "Entertainment" on the details of the Expense Report.
                  In the event the meal is organized for a particular project, the expenditure should be charged to
                  entertainment with a project code for summing with the other project related expenses.<br><br>
                  25.HR could determine guidelines for an acceptable average spending on meals according to the
                  prevailing local practices or financial consideration.<br><br>
                  26.Expensive alcoholic beverages will not be reimbursed.<br><br>
                  27.At department level, entertainment expenses should be monitored against the budget sum which
                  should be established based on a reasonable spending limit per manager or senior executive on
                  annual basis. The spending limit for position with project nature or responsibility may be established
                  on a different scale based on the business needs.<br><br>
                  <b>Conferences</b><br>
                  28.All conferences must have the prior approval from the Chairman in writing. Spend responsibly when
                  booking such events. As the costs of such events are usually quite significant, GM should seriously
                  weigh costs and benefits of such events before seeking approval.<br><br>
                  29.All expenses should be recorded as Staff Cost. Overseas travel and meals incurred for the
                  conference should follow the paragraph on Overseas Travel and Meal Expense during Overseas
                  Travel.<br><br>
                  <b>Holiday Parties</b><br>
                  30.Reasonable official lunch/dinner or holiday parties can be organized for team or department.
                  However, these should be kept to a maximum of 2 per year and managed within the department
                  employee activities budget.<br><br>
                  31.All expenses should be recorded as Staff Cost on the Expense Report and the claims will be
                  reviewed by Human Resources.<br><br>
                  <b>Expense Reimbursement</b><br>
                  32.Business expenses shall be reimbursed only against claims which are signed by an employee,
                  supported by original meal, i.e., computer-generated receipts with itemized breakdown where
                  feasible and credit card receipts (except for settlement by cash), and approved according to
                  delegated authority in force from time to time by his immediate senior or another person to whom
                  that immediate senior is accountable. When expenses are incurred without supporting receipt, a
                  remark and reason have to be stated on the Expense Report and initialed by the authorizing
                  manager as approved or not.<br><br>
                  33.All overseas travel expense claims should be supported by boarding passes and an approved
                  Travel Authorization Form.<br><br>
                  34.No claim shall be reimbursed unless it is submitted prior to the end of the second month following
                  the month in which such business expenses were incurred (the "Settlement Period"), though in
                  exceptional circumstances claims submitted after the Settlement Period may be reimbursed if the
                  employee has obtained the specific approval in writing of the GM or COO. Any cash advances
                  unreconciled at the end of this Settlement Period shall be deducted automatically from payroll.<br><br>
                  35.No employee shall approve reimbursement of his own business expenses whether directly incurred
                  by himself or indirectly by another.<br><br>
                  36.All business expenses in a foreign currency will be reimbursed in the local currency or in US
                  dollars.
                  For foreign currency expenses paid by cash, the amount will be converted into Local Currency or
                  US dollars at the actual foreign exchange rate printed on the receipt issued by the banks or forex
                  bureau in which the employee did the exchange. For those expenses paid by credit card, the actual
                  exchange rates applied by the banks as printed on the supporting credit card statements may be
                  used. Alternatively, the Head of Finance may select an exchange rate for conversion with reference
                  to the note-selling rates quoted by a major bank on the first day of the trip. If conversion into US
                  dollars takes place as a result of this reimbursement process, fees and bank charges that are
                  reasonable in the circumstances shall be borne by the company.<br><br>
                  37.Reimbursement for all other expenses for items not specified in this policy should require prior
                  approval by the Chairman, CEO or COO and advance written approval should be attached to the
                  Expense Report.
